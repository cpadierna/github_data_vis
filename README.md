## Top 30-Starred Python Projects on GitHub

This Python script makes an API request to GitHub and translates the data into a top 30-starred Python projects graph for your use.

The graph will give you a title of each project, and you will be able to click on each bar. Each link brings you to the GitHub repository so you may check out the project yourself. 

## Notes before using this script

This Python script uses **Matplotlib**, **requests library**, **plotly library**, and **pygal library**. Keep these in mind in case there are any errors with running this script.

### 3. Run the Python script with Ctrl + F5 on Windows or Fn + F5 on Mac.
### 4. This script will run and create a file called "python_repos.svg" This file is the data visualization with clickable links. This file will automatically be created & saved onto your system. Over time, this data will become outdated. If you run the script again the "python_repos.svg" file will populate and update the graph.
