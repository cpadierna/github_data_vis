## Top 30-Starred Python Projects on GitHub

This Python script makes an API request to GitHub and translates the data into a top 30-starred Python projects graph for your use.

The graph will give you a title of each project, and you will be able to click on each bar. Each link brings you to the GitHub repository so you may check out the project yourself. 

## Notes before using this script

This Python script uses **Matplotlib**, **requests library**, **plotly library**, and **pygal library**. Keep these in mind in case there are any errors with running this script.

## How do I use this Python script?

### 1. Download the [source files](https://www.github.com/cpadierna/github_data_vis) from GitHub.
### 2. Open the file "python_repos.py".
### 3. Run the Python script with Ctrl + F5 on Windows or Fn + F5 on Mac.
### 4. This script will run and create a file called "python_repos.svg" This file is the data visualization with clickable links. This file will automatically be created & saved onto your system. Over time, this data will become outdated. If you run the script again the "python_repos.svg" file will populate and update the graph. 

### Enjoy!
